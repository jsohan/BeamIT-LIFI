# Description:
Our project is a visual light communications system that can transmit and receive text (digital data) and sound (analog data) to distances greater than 14 FT. The prject is comprised of two sub-systems:
- Digital: Our approach was to use a
microcontroller to serialize text data to be
transmitted via laser module. To receive this
data we used a module we designed our
selves which consists of a photodiode, two
220K resistors, a 10k potentiometer, and and
OP Amp
- Analog: Using a spliced aux cord connected to
our phone we were able to send analog signals
through our laser module and receive them
using a solar panel an amplifier to play these
signals through a speaker

# Languages Used:
- C++ (Audino IDE)
